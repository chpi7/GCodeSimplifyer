Function 1: Convert all values to integers

As a result of Function 1 there may be duplicate lines, thats why there is:

Function 2: Remove duplicates


Planned update: Improve Remove Decimal function to not only remove the numbers after the decimal point but to round the numbers and get rid of the decimals that way.

I made this software for my DIY Plotter which only uses whole numbers and making
this programm was the fastest way to achieve a clean set of instructions for my machine.

Maybe someone else has the same problem of finding the approriate CAM Software which is free and
can do whole numbers only and therefore finds my software usefull.
